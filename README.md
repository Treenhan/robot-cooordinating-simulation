## Synopsis
In this project, I am asked to write a program to find a path for a robot to go from a point to another in a maze without colliding with obstacles. This robot consists of a number of fixed-length arms connected together by joints. 

## Installation
1. Change the working directory into the repository.
2. Run "ant" to build everything or "ant clean" to clean everything
3. The executable jar file will be inside the "dist" folder after building everything.
4. Change the working directory into "dist" and run the program by typing:
"java -jar coordinating-simulation.jar [input file] [output file]"
